If a note was deleted the app should be able to re-use its numéritation, to do that it should re-organize the notes like this:


1) Note one
(IF THIS WAS REMOVED)2) Note two
3) Note three




to this


1) Note one
2) Note three


So if a new note was added then:


1) Note one
2) Note three
3) Note four
